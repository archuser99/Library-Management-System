# Library-Management-System
A console-based Library Management System developed as a Computer Science student project to practice core C programming concepts.

### C programming concepts
This project demonstrates the use of:
- **Singly linked lists** for efficient book storage and manipulation
- **Structs and typedefs** for modeling books, list of books, author and users names
- **Dynamic memory allocation** (malloc/free) for nodes
- **File handling** for persistent storage (saving/loading books)
- Modular design with separate headers (.h) and implementation files (.c)

### Features
- Add, view, search, edit, and delete books
- Detailed author information (first, second/middle, last name)
- Sorted insertion and display (e.g., by title or author)
- Print and manage the entire book catalog
- Robust error handling and memory management

Built with standard C (compatible with GCC).
I used the Unity Test framework (https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) and I used Doxygen to generate documentation (https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen).
